									<h3> The Opportunity:</h3>
									<p> This project focuses on analyzing earthquake activity in Greece using real earthquake data recorded from 01/01/2022 to 14/02/2025. 
									The goal is to store, clean, analyze, and derive meaningful insights from the data, using SQL Server for data management and querying.</p>
								
								
									<h4>What is an Earthquake?</h4>

										<p>An earthquake is the shaking of the ground caused by the rupture of rocks, which is the result of a long-term process of accumulating dynamic energy in stressed areas of the lithosphere.

										An earthquake occurs when the mechanical equilibrium of rocks is disturbed by natural causes related to the Earth's interior.

										How do we measure earthquakes?

										To compare earthquakes, a measure of their strength was needed. Thus, the Magnitude (M) of an earthquake was defined, which represents the amount of energy released from the focus during earthquake activity.

										Magnitude is determined by measuring various parameters of earthquake waves, such as amplitude, period, and duration.

										Several magnitude scales have been devised for this purpose. The most well-known is the local magnitude scale (ML), also known as the Richter scale.

										The largest earthquake ever recorded globally had a magnitude of 9.5 (Chile, 22-5-1960).</p>
										
								
									<h4>Data Source</h4>
										<p>The earthquake data used in this analysis were obtained from the National Observatory of Athens - Geodynamic Institute. 
										The data were extracted from their official database, accessible at: Geodynamic Institute Search Database.</p>
										
								
								
									<h4>Data Extraction and Loading</h4>
									<p>The earthquake data were collected from reliable sources and imported into SQL Server. The dataset includes attributes such as:</p>
										<ul>
										<li><p>Origin Time (GMT)</p></li>

										<li><p>Latitude & Longitude</p></li>

										<li><p>Depth (km)</p></li>

										<li><p>Magnitude (ML)</p></li>

										<li><p>Location & Region</p></li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>A Data Warehouse structure was designed to efficiently store and analyze the data.</p>

								            
				
									<h4>Data Cleaning & Modelling</h4>
									<h4>During data processing:</h4>
										<ul>
										<li><p>Null values were replaced where applicable.</p></li>

										<li><p>Data types were standardized.</p></li>

										<li><p>Fact and Dimension tables were created to optimize querying performance.</p></li>
										</ul>


									<h4> Key Insights </h4>
									<h4> 1. Earthquake Activity by Region </h4>
											
												<ul>
												<li><p> Identified the regions with the highest number of recorded earthquakes.</p></li>

												<li><p> Determined the regions with the most high-magnitude (>6.0) earthquakes.</p></li>
												
												</ul>
												
									<h4>2. Strongest Earthquakes Analysis</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p> Found the strongest earthquake recorded per region.</p></li>
												
												<li><p> Listed the top 3 strongest earthquakes in each region.</p></li>
												</ul>

												
									<h4>3. Time-Based Earthquake Trends</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p> Identified peak times and months for earthquake activity.</p></li>											
												
												<li><p> Analyzed the most earthquake-prone days and hours.</p></li>
												</ul>
												
									<h4>4. Depth vs. Magnitude Correlation</h4>		
												<ul>
												<li><p>Examined if earthquakes are occurring at greater depths over time.</p></li>
											    
												<li><p> Determined the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude per region.</p></li>											
											
												</ul>
												
									<h4>5. Earthquake Clusters and Patterns</h4>
												<ul>
												<li><p>Detected regions experiencing earthquake swarms within 48-hour periods.</p></li>
											    
												<li><p> Identified locations with recurring earthquake activity.</p></li>											
											
												</ul>
									
									
									<h4>6. Spatial Analysis of Earthquakes</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p>Found earthquakes occurring within a 100 km radius of major cities (e.g., Athens).</p></li>
											    
												<li><p> Assessed proximity-based earthquake risk for different locations.</p></li>											
											
												</ul>
												
									<h4> 7. Risk Assessment for Future Earthquakes</h4>
											     <ul>
												<li><p>Estimated the probability of a future earthquake >6.0 per region based on historical data.</p></li>
											    
												<li><p> Highlighted regions with a higher likelihood of strong earthquakes.</p></li>											
											
												</ul>
												
											
									<h3>The Outcome</h3>
									<p> This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze and extract insights from earthquake activity data. By leveraging SQL queries, we can uncover trends, detect patterns, and perform in-depth analysis to better understand earthquake behavior in Greece.</p>
